BootPanel - PHP Server Control Panel
=========
BootPanel is a BootStrap designed Server Control Panel written in PHP.  It has a built in API for both Themes and Plugins as well as a customization feature for server hosts to limit their clients usage.

###My Thoughts
 - Pocketmine should always be started in the Web Application
 - The Connection will be terminated after 5 Mins (Configurable).
 - To Show the Console I will use Log Files.
     - Log Files Will be called every 1 Sec.
     - Not Sure to Try and SFTP in and get it that way or use Console....
     - This Will be Hard to choose
 - Commands will be sent using SSH2 Extention.
